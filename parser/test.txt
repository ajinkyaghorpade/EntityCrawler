BILL DE BLASIO’S MIDDLE GROUND

During his first months in office, Mayor Bill de Blasio was snowed upon from the heavens, sandbagged by the governor and his charter-school allies, and kicked by supporters of Central Park’s carriage horses. Now he is getting down to work. Last week, he reached a pay deal with the teachers’ union that he hopes will serve as a model for agreements with other city workers, and on Monday he released his housing plan, which, he said, would create or preserve two hundred thousand affordable units over the next ten years. Meanwhile, his administration is working on greatly increasing the number of full-day pre-kindergarten slots that the city provides, using money recently obtained from Albany.

Action on numerous fronts should help to alleviate concerns that de Blasio isn’t up to the job. It also illustrates something else, which was evident in his time as a city councilman, Clinton Administration official, and public advocate: he’s actually a pretty moderate and pragmatic fellow, who tends to hew to the middle ground. He has no intention of ditching the populist message that won him the mayoralty and earned him a national reputation as a crusader against rising inequality, but many of the policies he is adopting are similar to ones adopted by other moderate Democrats around the country, and even by moderate Republicans, such as his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg.

De Blasio’s willingness to compromise was shown in the brouhaha over charter schools, when Governor Andrew Cuomo, Eva Moskovitz, the C.E.O. of Success Academy, a charter operator, and their Wall Street allies attacked him for refusing to allow a handful of Success Academy schools to co-locate in public schools. This dispute was a bit of a sideshow. De Blasio, far from trying to roll back the charter-school movement in New York, authorized a big expansion in the number of charters, which Bloomberg had set in train. And he quietly dropped a campaign proposal to charge charters rent when they co-locate in city schools. “If you look at what [de Blasio] actually did as opposed to what he said, he did approve the opening of most of the charters,” Charles Barone, the policy director of Democrats for Education Reform, a pro-charter group, told the Huffington Post. “He gave co-location space to most of the charters that wanted co-location space. We’re not saying he had an ideological conversion, but regardless, he wound up doing a lot more on charters than one might have expected, given his campaign.”

The deal that de Blasio’s negotiators struck with the teachers’ union was squarely in the tradition of agreements reached under Bloomberg and Rudolph Giuliani. It gave a bit to everyone, while avoiding the radical choices demanded by the left and the right. In return for significant retroactive pay increases to match the deals reached by other city unions in 2009 and 2010—when they were without a new contract—the teachers agreed to accept modest hikes for the rest of their contract period. In total, the annual raises come to eighteen per cent over ten years, which means they will barely match overall consumer price inflation, and surely won’t match the rise in the cost of living in New York.

Some teachers wanted much bigger raises, but the union agreed to modest increases in return for keeping their generous health and retirement benefits largely intact. The administration said the deal included $1.3 billion in health-care savings, but it didn’t say where these would come from. The teachers won’t see any increase in their premiums or co-payments, a change that fiscal conservatives were demanding. “Ninety percent of the city’s employees still receive health care while bearing none of the cost of their premiums,” Stephen Malanga, of the Manhattan Institute, pointed out in a blog post. “The new contract won’t change that.”

That’s true. However, even conservatives could hardly have expected a progressive mayor, who received the support of the teacher’s union during his election campaign, to launch a Chris Christie-style assault on the contracts and perquisites of city workers. Giuliani and Bloomberg were in office for twenty years, and they failed to do such a thing. The pay deal was parsimonious enough to win the approval of the Partnership for New York, a prominent business group, and the Citizens Budget Commission, whose president, Carol Kellerman, said, “This is a good basis for discussion with the other unions. They should understand the fiscal realities the teachers’ union was able to see.”

De Blasio’s housing plan is an ambitious one—on Monday, he said it will “change the face of this city forever.” But it doesn’t represent a complete break with the recent past, and it certainly doesn’t mark a return to the days of Fiorello La Guardia, whom the mayor referred to in his speech. Bloomberg, during his three terms, created or preserved about a hundred and seventy-five thousand units of affordable housing. De Blasio is aiming to exceed that record by twenty-five thousand in two fewer years. “In sum, the housing plan is slightly to the left of Bloomberg’s, but only slightly,” Stephen J. Smith wrote on Next City, a Web site devoted to urban affairs, adding, “At the end of de Blasio’s desired eight years, even if the administration achieves its headline goals for construction and affordability preservation, the upward climb in average housing costs in New York City will not stop.”

It’s hard to argue with that. History suggests that there are three ways of providing affordable housing: build a lot of public housing, which is what LaGuardia did during and after the Great Depression; impose rent controls, which is what F.D.R. did during the Second World War (after the war, the city and state administered the controls); and allow so much private-sector development that the cost of market-rate real estate finally falls. (That’s what Florida and Nevada did a decade ago, during the great real-estate bubble.)

Largely for reasons of cost, de Blasio has ruled out building a lot more public housing. And, although his appointees to the rent-control board are seeking to hold down rent hikes for people living in rent-stabilized apartments, the mayor hasn’t proposed reversing the Guiliani-era reforms that greatly reduced the number of apartments subject to rent controls. Instead, he intends to do something that cities like Boston and San Francisco did long ago: change the zoning laws to require developers to build more affordable housing in return for being allowed to put up bigger buildings.

This policy, which is known as “inclusive zoning,” is popular with moderate Democrats because it appears to utilize market forces for equitable ends. If you’ve been to Beantown or the Bay Area recently, however, you know it’s not a cure-all for the affordability problem. Academic studies show that inclusive zoning has had mixed results: in some areas, it seems to have expanded the number of affordable homes significantly; in others, it hasn’t. Some critics claim that it ends up accelerating gentrification, and leads to higher rents, as developers raze older, more affordable buildings. Other critics claim that, rather than housing middle-income people in luxury buildings, it would be more efficient to auction off all of the development rights to up-zoned lots, and use the proceeds to build or subsidize cheaper housing elsewhere.

With his support of the controversial Atlantic Yards development, which included an affordable-housing component that has yet to be built, de Blasio demonstrated that he is a believer in the “density equals diversity” argument. Now he has placed this idea at the center of his housing plan. It could be argued that, in some ways, this makes him a radical. But not in the old left-versus-right way.
